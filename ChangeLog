	* Makefile.am: Remove useless re-copy of config/fm.m4 in dist-hook.

2008-10-17  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>

	* include/candl/matrix.h,
	* source/matrix.c: Add candl_matrix_print_data, which prints a
	matrix in a parsable form for candl_matrix_read.
	* include/candl/candl.h.in: Update CANDL_FMT to %4...

	* source/program.c: Replace calls to pip_matrix_print by
	candl_matrix_print_data. The former caused bugs on ppc64.

2008-09-18  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	Enable Candl to act as a .scop to .candl converter.

	* include/candl/program.h,
	* source/program.c: Add candl_program_print_candl_file function,
	which dumps a .candl file from a candl_program_t structure.

	* include/candl/options.h,
	* source/options.c,
	* source/candl.c: Add support of option -scoptocandl, which
	converts a .scop to a .candl file.

	* include/candl/dependence.h,
	* include/candl/matrix.h,
	* include/candl/program.h: Minor fixes in includes.

2008-08-07  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch creates a .scop dumper for candl. Dependences are
	represented between the
	<candl><dependences>...</dependences></candl> tags. It is
	activated by providing a .scop file as the input (needing flag
	-inscop), and by using flag -outscop.

	* include/candl/dependence.h,
	* source/dependence.c: Create a .scop dumper, where the
	dependences are added in the optional tag.

	* include/candl/options.h,
	* source/candl.c,
	* source/options.c: Create option -outscop. Rename option -scop to
	-incsop.

	* tests/matmul.depscop,
	* tests/ax-do.depscop,
	* tests/gemver.depscop,
	* tests/swim.depscop: New. Reference test files for .scop dumper.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.
	* tests/checker.sh: Perform the .scop dumper checks.

	* include/candl/candl.h.in: Create the macro CANDL_FAIL.
	* include/candl/program.h,
	* source/program.c: Use the CANDL_FAIL macro in place of exit(1).

2008-07-25  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>

	* source/dependence.c: Fix typo in comments, don't rename a scalar
	if not needed.

	* source/program.c: Change optional tag for loop indices to
	<candl><indices>...</indices></candl>.

	* tests/ax-do.dep,
	* tests/matmul.struct,
	* tests/swim.opt.scop,

	* LICENSE: Delete.
	* COPYING.LESSER: Add GNU Lesser GPL notice.

	* doc/Doxyfile.in: Add missing macro definition.

2008-07-17  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>

	* source/dependence.c: Fix a typo in comments.

	* tests/matmul.scalstruct,
	* tests/ax-do.scalstruct,

	* tests/gemver.scalstruct: New. Add scalar analysis test reference
	files.

	* tests/checker.sh,

	* configure.in: Bump to candl-0.3.0
	* autoconf/candl.m4: Minor fixes.

2008-07-17  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch finalizes the scalar analysis pass. The following
	operations are available: scalar privatization, scalar expansion,
	scalar renaming, and test for privatizability.

	* include/candl/dependence.h,
	* source/dependence.c: Finalize scalar analysis. Add scalar
	expansion and scalar renaming. Refactor scalar privatization. Add
	dependence pruning via privatization.

	* include/candl/program.h,
	* source/program.c: Add and manage a field dedicated to store the
	list of privatizable variables.

	* include/candl/options.h,
	* source/options.c: Add options -scalexp, -scalpriv, -scalren,
	-verbose.

	* tests/Makefile.am,
	* tests/checker.sh: Remove useless re-test of .scop.

2008-07-15  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch re-implements scalar privatization via scalar expansion
	in the array access function. Code is conservative in very few
	cases, and yet robust.

	* include/candl/matrix.h,
	* source/matrix.c: Move and rename candl_dependence_check_point here.

	* include/candl/dependence.h,
	* source/dependence.c: Redesign scalar privatization.

	* include/candl/dependence.h,
	* source/dependence.c: Add SIV/ZIV/MIV/GCD test to accelerate
	dependence testing.

2008-07-14  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch finalizes the integration of Candl with new .scop
	format. Loop indices are either extracted from the identity
	scheduling matrix, either from the content of the optional <candl>
	tag in the .scop file. See tests/xxx.opt.scop for examples.

	* include/candl/program.h,
	* source/program.c: Add support for reading the iterator indices
	in the .scop file.

	* tests/swim.scop,
	* tests/swim.opt.scop,
	* tests/gemver.opt.scop,
	* tests/matmul.opt.scop,

	* tests/ax-do.opt.scop: New. Test files where the iterator indices
	are provided in the <candl> optional tag of the .scop file.

	* tests/checker.sh,
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.

2008-07-13  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
